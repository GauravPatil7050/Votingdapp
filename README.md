# Decentralized Voting Application

In this personal project, I've demonstrated how to construct a decentralized voting application from scratch. First, I created a Solidity smart contract to manage the voting process securely on the Ethereum blockchain. Then, I set up the Ethereum network for deployment. After that, I designed and implemented the front-end user interface using React JS, ensuring an intuitive and engaging voting experience for users. The end result is a fully operational decentralized voting application that leverages the Ethereum blockchain's security features, providing a transparent and tamper-resistant platform for conducting elections and polls.
